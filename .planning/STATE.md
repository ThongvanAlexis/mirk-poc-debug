# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-30)

**Core value:** The fog-of-war stays perfectly locked to the map during pan, zoom, and combined gestures on a sideloaded iOS build.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-30 — Roadmap created; 56/56 v1 requirements mapped to 5 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmapping: Stack locked to `flutter_map 7.0.2` + `vector_map_tiles 8.0.0` + `vector_map_tiles_pmtiles 1.5.0` (only resolvable chain); state mgmt = plain `StatefulWidget` + `setState` + constructor-injected services; iOS-primary on iPhone 17 Pro (ProMotion 120 Hz), Pixel 4a only at Phase 3 + Phase 5.
- Roadmapping: Falsification Criterion C (parent-FPS comparison) DROPPED — POC stands on absolute FPS + lock-correctness alone.
- Roadmapping: 5-phase structure under coarse granularity; Bootstrap + CI + logger + share + FPS counter + permission gate folded into a single walkable Phase 1 ("install → permission screen → share logs").
- Roadmapping: Phase 2 PERF-02 (≥ 40 fps no-fog on iPhone 17 Pro) is the hard gate before Phase 3 fog work begins; failing it forces label-thinning before the hypothesis is testable.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Phase 1 dependency on SideStore: developer's pairing-file + "Disable App Limit" toggle status must be confirmed before the first IPA sideload UAT (research flagged LOW confidence on share_plus + Mail byte-integrity on free-Apple-ID build; Phase 1 must include the 50 MB synthetic-log smoke test as the UAT exit gate).
- Phase 2 vector-tile FPS on iOS at zoom 13–15 has no published numbers; the Phase 2 walk IS the research, and is the highest-probability project-blocking risk.
